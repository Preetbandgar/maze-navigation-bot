# ROS2 Maze Navigation Bot 🧭

> **Status**: In Progress | **Target**: Compatible with TurtleBot3

## 🔍 Overview
This project implements an autonomous maze-solving robot using **ROS2**, **Nav2**, and **RTAB-Map SLAM**. The navigation stack is tested in simulation and designed for real-world compatibility with **TurtleBot3** hardware.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- ROS2 Humble
- Nav2 Navigation Stack
- RTAB-Map SLAM
- URDF & TF
- RViz2
- Gazebo
- Python3

## 📁 Project Structure (Planned)
```
/launch         → ROS2 launch files  
/urdf           → Robot description (xacro, meshes)  
/config         → SLAM and Nav2 parameter files  
/scripts        → Utility tools and automation scripts  
/maps           → SLAM-generated or static maps  
/docs           → Design notes and system architecture
```
